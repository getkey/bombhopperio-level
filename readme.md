# BombHopper.io level tools

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/bombhopperio-level)

This library is used to validate levels. Maybe it will have more level-related features later, like upgrading from an old format version into a newer.

```sh
yarn add bombhopperio-level
```

or

```sh
npm install bombhopperio-level
```
